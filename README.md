## Project Description

In this continuous formative assessment, our goal is to design and develop an enterprise-level fullstack application.  

The application will:  

- Process MoMo SMS data in XML format
- Clean and categorize the data  
- Store it in a relational database (SQLite or equivalent)
- Provide a frontend interface to analyze and visualize the data  

This project demonstrates backend data processing, database management, and frontend development skills.  

For Week 1, the focus is on:

- Setting up our teamâ€™s shared workspace
- Defining our system architecture  
- Organizing tasks using Agile practices
